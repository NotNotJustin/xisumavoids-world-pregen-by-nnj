# Welcome to XisumaVoid's World Pregen, released for public use by NotNotJustin.

There are two Editions of this program, being Fast & Slow. If you believe your PC is on the low-end side of builds, please use the Slow Edition. If your PC is high-end, please use the Fast Edition. Use the correct program for your computer's speed and all will run smoothly.

These programs were originally designed by XisumaVoid and one of his friend's, but was tinkered with a bit by myself, NNJ. The programs were designed in AutoHotKey, or AHK.

To start the Script, please run the program cooresponding to your PC's speed, click into your minecraft window, and press CTRL + Alt + Q. Make sure you are in Creative Mode and are flying so this may run properly. I have not tested this in any dimension other than the Overworld, so if you feel it will work, please, by all means, try this in the Nether and/or the End.

This program runs seperate from Minecraft, so it will not be updated regularly, or at all. The current release should work on all versions of Minecraft from 1.14 and above, as the commands are in the 1.14 format.
